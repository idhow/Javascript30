    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    team3[3] = 'brian';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap = person;
    cap.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 50});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const me = {
      name: 'ido',
      age: 100,
      social: {

      }
    }

    console.table(me);
    
    // just 1 level deep
    const dev = Object.assign({}, me); 

    // deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(me));
